[About README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

If you put your README.md file in your repository's root directory, or in the hidden .github or docs directory, GitHub recognizes and automatically surfaces your README to repository visitors. If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order:

The .github directory
The repository's root directory
The docs directory
