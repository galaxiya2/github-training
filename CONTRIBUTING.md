[Awesome READMI](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

If you put your README.md file in your repository's root directory, or in the hidden .github or docs directory, GitHub recognizes and automatically surfaces your README to repository visitors. If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order:

The .github directory
The repository's root directory
The docs directory
